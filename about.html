                    <h2>2020</h2>
                    <p>Given the CoVID-19 situation, we have reduced the number of meet up sessions. As phase 3 is nearing, the committee has decided to regulate the meet up sessions but with only a maximum of 8 people per session. Session numbers would remain the same to minimize outside contact to keep you and your kids safe.</p>
